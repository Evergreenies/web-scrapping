1,"Muzaffarpur rapes: 'Stray incident,' says CM Nitish Kumar","NEW DELHI: Following criticism by opposition parties, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Sunday said that some people are merely focussing on ""one or two"" negative incidents while referring to the Muzaffarpur shelter home case in which as many as 30 minor girls were sexually abused.


The Bihar chief minister who has been facing flak for his government's alleged inaction against the perpetrators today said that ""guilty will not be spared"".

""You should try to focus on positive feed as well. One or two negative incidents have happened and you are focusing only on it. Whosoever tries to create a mischief will be taken to task. Those who are trying to protect them will also not be spared, they too will be sent to prison,"" Kumar was quoted as saying by the news agency ANI.


Zara positive feed par bhi aap log kripa karke dekh lein. Ek aad negative cheez hogya usi ko lekar chal rahe hain.… https://t.co/DOXBNvRqLB— ANI (@ANI) 1533459683000
An annoyed chief minister slammed the people targeting him and his government over the case. ""If all you want to do is abuse me, then go ahead,"" Kumar added.

Kumar's remark came in the backdrop of a protest against his state government organized by RJD leader and Kumar's arch-rival Tejashwi Yadav in the national capital yesterday.

On Saturday, Yadav, in an apparent show of opposition unity, had organized a protest in Delhi's Jantar Mantar along with Congress chief Rahul Gandhi and leaders from various regional parties.

""Today, as a Bihari, I hang my head in shame. What has happened in this case, shows that it is not 'jungle raj' (misrule) but 'rakchhas raj' (devil's rule) in the state,"" Yadav said.

Besides Rahul, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, MPs including Tejashwi's sister Misa Bharti and D Raja, Bihar's former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury, former MP Sharad Yadav and others also took part in the protest.

Two days ago, the chief minister had expressed anguish over the Muzaffarpur shelter home sex scandal and stressed on the need to develop institutional mechanisms to prevent such incidents from recurring.

 ""We have always said that the guilty would not be spared and deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi has said on the floor of the assembly that we would ourselves like the CBI probe to be monitored by the High Court,"" he had said in his first reaction since the scandal broke last month.

The Muzaffarpur shelter home incident had surfaced in a social audit conducted by Mumbai-based Tata Institute of Social Sciences. An FIR was lodged by the state social welfare department in June, which led to the arrest of 10 people. Medical reports have confirmed sexual abuse of more than 30 girls formerly lodged at the shelter home, which has since been sealed. The case has been handed over to the CBI.

2,Amarnath yatra suspended from Jammu due to protests in support of Article 35-A,"JAMMU: Amarnath yatra was today suspended from Jammu in view of the two day separatist sponsored strike against the legal challenge in the Supreme Court on the validity of Article 35-A.


There were reports of partial strike and peaceful rallies in support of the Article 35-A from Chenab valley districts of Ramban, Doda and Kishtwar.

Various religious and social organisations have given the two-day strike to ""safeguard"" the constitutional provision.

A police official said the yatra was suspended from here as a precautionary measure in view of the strike called by the Joint Resistance Leadership (JRL). 

A few hundred pilgrims camping in Jammu to join the yatra to the 3,880 metre high holy cave shrine of Amarnath in south Kashmir Himalayas were not allowed from the Bhagwati Nagar base camp this morning, the officials said. 

The separatists and the major political parties including National Conference, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) CPI(M) and the state unit of Congress have been demanding status quo on the Article 35-A, which bars people from outside Jammu and Kashmir from acquiring any immovable property in the state.

Supreme Court is scheduled to hear a PIL challenging the validity of the Article 35-A tomorrow.

The state government has filed an application before the Registrar of the Supreme Court, informing that it is going to seek adjournment of the hearing of the petition in view of the ""ongoing preparations for the upcoming Panchayat, urban local body and municipal elections in the state"".

Groups of people also staged peaceful rallies at several places including Gool, Sangaldan and Banihal in support of the Article 35A, the officials said, adding local public transport remained off the roads in many areas of the hilly districts.

3,Not averse to projecting Mamata Banerjee as prime ministerial face: HD Deve Gowda,"NEW DELHI: Pitching for a ""formidable front"" against the BJP, former prime minister and JD(S) supremo HD Deve Gowda has said he is not averse to projecting TMC chief and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee as the Opposition's prime ministerial face for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.


The remark by Gowda, 85, comes against the backdrop of reports that the Congress and other opposition parties favour leaving the issue of a prime ministerial candidate for the post-election phase as they feel that opposition unity could be hurt if the subject is taken up ahead of the polls.

The remark also comes days after top Congress sources indicated that the party will not mind a nominee for the top post from any Opposition alliance which does not have the backing of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).

Gowda, whose party has formed a coalition government in Karnataka with the support of the Congress, said the Congress will play a crucial role in forging opposition unity in the bid by the alliance to dislodge the BJP from power.

In an interview to PTI in Delhi over the weekend, the former prime minister noted while the formation of a third front is still in the ""early stage"" Banerjee is ""trying her best"" to bring all the non-BJP parties together. Gowda headed the Janata Dal-led United Front(UF) coalition government in 1996 but his tenure did not last more than a year.

Banerjee is pursuing the task of the formation of a federal front seriously after the draft National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam that excluded 40 lakh people from the list in the eastern state, he said.

Banerjee is a bitter critic of the NRC and has pilloried the BJP over the citizenship issue. She is also seeking the support of other opposition parties to take on the ruling party. The BJP has stoutly defended the Supreme Court-mandated exercise, saying it concerned national security and safety of the country's citizens.

Asked if he would support the TMC chief as the prime ministerial face of the opposition, Gowda said: ""Most welcome if Mamata is projected as PM. Indira Gandhi ruled as prime minister for 17 years. Why should we (men) alone become PM? Why not Mamata or Mayawati?""

Indicating he is not opposed to a woman prime minister, Gowda said he had piloted the women's reservation bill in Parliament way back in 1996.

Noting that the JD(S) has not made any effort to unify regional parties so far, he however said the regional party is prepared to cooperate with other parties to fight the BJP.

""It is because there is a sense of fear in the country. There is a suffocating atmosphere for minorities in states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Gujarat. A formidable front is necessary to take on the BJP in 2019,"" he noted.

Observing that the clamour for a political alternative to BJP will gradually gain momentum, Gowda stressed that the Congress as a national party will also play a crucial role.

""I want to see how things will shape up in the next 2-3 months,"" he added.

Gowda also mentioned that the Congress and his party will fight together in Karnataka during 2019 general polls. However, the issue of seat sharing has not been discussed yet, he said. Karnataka accounts for 28 Lok Sabha seats.

4,Govt should've consulted all parties on NRC: Sharad Yadav,"BHOPAL: The Centre should have consulted all parties to work out a ""unanimous mechanism"" before going ahead with the National Register of Citizens (NRC) exercise in Assam, Loktantrik Janata Dal leader Sharad Yadav has said.


Taking a dig at the Modi government, the former Union minister said it has been unable to ensure the safety of women and girls in the country but talks of cow protection.

The NRC, a list of Assam citizens, was published on July 30 with the names of over 40 lakh residents of the state not being included in it.

""The government should have called an all-party meeting to find out an amicable solution to the problem in Assam. But if you do it just like that, you won't be able to do it by just declaring a cut-off date... you will get tired,"" Yadav told PTI in an interview.

The former Janata Dal (United) chief said he agrees that the issue of Assam has ""reflections on democracy"", but asserted they should have found a ""justifiable solution of the problem and a unanimous mechanism"" for it.

Criticised the BJP, Yadav said, ""This party is not giving ticket to any Muslim. Therefore, we are not ready to believe that it will do justice with them.""

""People have come here from Tibet. Bangladeshis had come and gone to Bangladesh. When Pakistan was created, a large number of people went there and were called 'Mohajirs', and Sikhs too had come here from there,"" he said.

This movement of population took place maximum in India, he claimed.

""No proper debates are taking place in Parliament. Many agitations are going on in the country. If you find on which date a person had come to this country, then it (country) will get destroyed,"" he said.

On the bill tabled in Parliament to overturn the Supreme Court verdict putting safeguards on arrests under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, Yadav claimed the government has done so ""under pressure"" in view of the bandh call given by all opposition parties.

""Dalits came to my place and strategies for both (bandh) 2nd (April 2) and on ninth (August 9) were formulated. Everyone, including Ambedkarites and others like Sharad Pawar, and other parties supported it,"" he added.

The bill was brought under pressure, otherwise the government could have fallen on the issue, he said.

""The government should have brought it at the time when the Supreme Court had given that judgement of diluting the SC/ST Act,"" he said.

The Supreme Court had in an order on March 20 diluted certain provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

It had laid down new guidelines for police officers on how to ensure that innocent people, especially public officials, are protected from false complaints under the Act.

Dalit groups had organised protests across the country on April 2 against the ""dilution"" of the Act.

Asked if he would support the candidature of Congress president Rahul Gandhi for the prime minister's post in the next elections, Yadav said the party had itself clarified its position on the issue. Therefore, there is no need for him to make a statement on it.

The Congress said its first objective is to stop the BJP from coming to power in 2019, he noted, adding that saving the Constitution and democracy is a major issue.

""The time is to save the democracy, like in 1977. That was a declared Emergency but this time it is undeclared, in which one cannot predict where things will go wrong,"" he said.

Further criticising the central government, Yadav alleged that it is unable to protect women and girls and ""talks about cow first"".

""They have become a champion of cows,"" he quipped.

5,India hands over request to Antigua to extradite Mehul Choksi,"NEW DELHI: India has handed over a request to Antigua for extradition of bank fraud fugitive Mehul Choksi who has obtained citizenship of the Caribbean nation.


Official sources said a team from India was sent to Antigua few days back to pursue the authorities there to extradite Choksi.

""The team met the foreign ministry officials of the island nation yesterday and handed over the request to extradite Choksi to India,"" an official source said.

Choksi is one of the alleged masterminds of the $2 billion scam in state-run Punjab National Bank and is an uncle of fugitive diamantaire Nirav Modi.

He is wanted in India by the CBI and enforcement directorate probing the fraud, the biggest banking scam in the country.

As per reports, Antiguan authorities cleared his citizenship in November 2017 after India did not give any adverse report to stall his application.

Choksi had fled India on January 4 this year and took oath of allegiance in Antigua on January 15.

The CBI had sent its request to the Ministry of External Affairs for extradition of Choksi.

Choksi's application for citizenship in Antigua in May 2017 was accompanied with clearance from the local police as required by norms, Antiguan newspaper the Daily Observer reported, citing a statement from the Citizenship by Investment Unit of Antigua and Barbuda (CIU).

It said the police clearance certificate (PCC) from the Regional Passport Office in Mumbai said that there was no adverse information against Choksi which would render him ineligible for grant of travel facilities including visa for Antigua and Barbuda.

When asked about the PCC to Choksi, a spokesperson for the Ministry of External Affairs had said it was given on the basis of a clear police verification report (PVR) available on his passport.

Under the Citizenship by Investment Program of Antigua and Barbuda, a person can take their passport on a minimum investment of $1,00,000 in the NDF investment fund.

Choksi and his companies allegedly availed of credit from overseas branches of Indian banks using the fraudulent guarantees of PNB given through letters of undertaking (LoUs) and letters of credit issued by the Brady House branch which were not repaid, bringing liability on the state-run bank, the officials have said.

An LoU is a guarantee given by an issuing bank to Indian banks having branches abroad to grant short-term credit to the applicant.

6,"Mamata's 'bloodbath', 'civil war' comment on NRC does not behove of a CM: Sonowal","NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal said on Sunday that his West Bengal counterpart Mamata Banerjee's ""inflammatory"" comment on NRC does not behove of a senior politician and asserted that his government was committed to complete the exercise as per the Supreme Court order.


Sonowal, a student-leader-turned politician, said precious time of Parliament were wasted by stalling its proceedings by Banerjee's party, the Trinamool Congress, by spreading ""false propaganda"" and ""wrong information"" on National Register of Citizens (NRC), a list of Assam's citizens.

""Not a single law and order situation has arisen in Assam after the publication of the draft NRC, which was complete fair and transparent. 

""The statements of the West Bengal chief minister were inflammatory and divisive and aimed at her vote bank in her own state. It does not behove of a chief minister,"" he told PTI in a telephonic interview from Guwahati.

Sonowal, 55, was responding to a question on Mamata's comment that the NRC exercise in Assam was done with a ""political motive"" to divide people and it would lead to ""bloodbath"" and a ""civil war"" in the country.

He said rumours have been spread about the NRC in the country as well as abroad but he was thankful to the people of Assam, especially those from the Barak valley and the Bengalis, who did not fall to the prey to the ""evil design"" of the ""outside"" forces which tried to instigate people for ""narrow political gain"".

Sonowal also blasted the Congress for trying to take credit for the publication of draft NRC after initially criticising it.

""The Congress government in the state even failed to complete a pilot project on NRC launched in 2010 due to law and order problems. It was our government which took the initiative under the Supreme Court order and expedited the whole process in the last two years,"" he said.

The chief minister, who first went to the NRC office after taking oath in 2016 even before attending his office, said he was committed to complete the entire NRC update process as per the apex court mandate.

He said, as a chief minister, he will ensure that not a single Indian is left out from the final NRC.

Sonowal also profusely thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Rajnath Singh for their wholehearted support to the complex exercise.

Sonowal also dwelt on the Assam's relations with West Bengal saying the two states share harmonious relations since ages and scholars like Ashutosh Mukherjee helped introducing Assamese language in the Calcutta University early 20th century.

He said the people of Assam were guided by the humanitarian and unifying philosophies of singers Bhupen Hazarika and Hemanga Biswas and the former spent his prime time of his career in Kolkata producing some of his immortal creations both in Assamese and Bengali.

Sonowal said even renowned Assamese littérateur Lakshminath Bezbaroa strengthened the intrinsic relations by marrying Noble Laureate Rabindranath Tagore's grand-daughter Pragya Sundari.

""Therefore, being a chief minister of such a state which has its deep-rooted culture and traditions, Mamata Banerjee should not have made such baseless comments which have got communal undertone aimed at disturbing the strong relations between Assam and Bengal,"" he said.

Sonowal also thanked the Registrar General of India and the NRC authorities for carrying out the successful work of the NRC update as per the Supreme Court directive.

The massive Supreme Court-monitored exercise to identify genuine Indian nationals living in Assam excluded over 40 lakh people from the draft list published on July 30, creating a huge political controversy.

7,Prez nod to law to deter fugitive economic offenders from fleeing country,"NEW DELHI: President Ram Nath Kovind has given assent to a law that will deter fugitive economic offenders to evade legal process in India and flee the country.


A fugitive economic offender is any individual against whom warrants for arrest is issued for his involvement in select economic offences involving amount of at least Rs 100 crore or more and has left India so as to avoid criminal prosecution.

The Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, 2018 has got the nod from the president, according to an official order.

The new legislation will prevent big economic offenders like Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi from fleeing the country and evading the law.

Both Mallya and Modi, wanted in cases being probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), are out of India.

The new law allows designated special court to declare a person as fugitive economic offender and to confiscate his property, including 'benami' ones.

""All the rights and title in the confiscated property shall, from the date of the confiscation order, vest in the central government, free from all encumbrances,"" the Act says.

The Fugitive Economic Offenders Bill, 2018 was passed by the Rajya Sabha on July 25. The Lok Sabha had cleared the measure on July 19.

Justifying the financial limit of Rs 100 crore for invoking the provisions of this new law, Finance Minister Piyush Goyal had recently said in Parliament that it was being done to ""catch the big offenders and not to clog the courts"".

""This bill is an effective, expeditious and constitutional way to stop these offenders from running away. Legislative changes or a new law must be in place to confiscate assets of such absconders till they don't present themselves in front of the courts. We will also work out what has to be done with the confiscated assets,"" Goyal had said in Rajya Sabha.

The Enforcement Directorate will be the investigative agency under the Act, he had said.

The president has also given nod to other laws-- the Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Act, 2018, the State Banks (Repeal and Amendment) Act, 2018 and the Specific Relief (Amendment) Act, 2018.

The Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Act is aimed at allowing a court to try offences related to cheque bounce expeditiously and direct the drawee to pay a minimum of 20 per cent of the cheque amount as interim compensation.

The State Banks (Repeal and Amendment) Act is to repeal two other laws --The State Bank of India (Subsidiary Banks) Act, 1959 and the State Bank of Hyderabad Act, 1956-- and to further amend the State Bank of India Act of 1955.

The Specific Relief (Amendment) Act, 2018 grants a party the right to seek damages from the other side in case of a breach of a business contract and to reduce discretion of courts in such matters.

Bills in these regards were approved by Parliament recently.

8,"TRAI chief defends pesky calls rules, says has mandate to save customers","NEW DELHI: Amid a disquiet in the industry over new unsolicited commercial communication norms, TRAI has asserted that it operated within its mandate to tighten rules for curbing pesky calls and messages, a menace which goes beyond harassment into the realm of defrauding customers.


Coming out in strong defence of the freshly-minted regulations, outgoing TRAI chairman RS Sharma told PTI that if any of the stakeholders felt that the said rules were illegal or beyond the regulator's mandate, they were free to seek legal remedies.

""We don't think we have exceeded any mandate. If some party feels it is not legal they can approach appropriate legal forum. We are concerned about the menace of pesky calls with regard to consumers. It is not merely about harassment, it goes beyond that...people are being duped financially with financial tips, and both SEBI and RBI had written to us,"" Sharma said.

Stating that the problem of unsolicited calls and messages from telemarketers, required ""everyone's cooperation"", Sharma said that the argument that other markets have not leveraged blockchain-based solutions to address the issue could not be used to say that India should not go for it.

""... it is a win-win situation for every stakeholder in the value chain except those illegal (indulging in illegal activities) or unsolicited commercial communications (UCC) players who are doing it beyond the law. It will help everyone except those who indulge in cheating and harassment,"" Sharma said in a recent interview.

Sharma also cleared the air around what the regulations would mean for TRAI's stand-off with tech titan Apple. In response to a question, Sharma emphasised that the regulations mention that customers must be enabled to report complaints for pesky calls, through various means, not just limited to TRAI's do-not disturb app.

""...application by TRAI, applications by a third party or the operating systems can themselves enable it through an app. We are not prescribing a methodology... be it TRAI or third party app. In any way, you can make provisions for your customers to complain about UCC and provide information ... when you get an (unsolicited telemarketing) call, you should able to share number and time and where the call came from,"" he explained without naming Apple.

On the industry's reservations over the use of blockchain technology for UCC, Sharma said that the regulator had held consultation with technical experts on blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).

""We have had consultation with tech experts who are into blockchain technology. It should be leveraged in delivering solutions, and I think it is a regulatory technology which should be used more often in many other situations, also. As far as argument that no one else is doing it...it is not a case enough to say India should not do it,"" he said.

The industry has raised red flag over TRAI's (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) new rules on curbing pesky calls and messages, and termed them ""complex"", ""time-consuming"" and without cost-benefit analysis.

The Cellular Operators' Association of India (COAI) said that tailoring of systems, and use of blockchain technology will involve Rs 200-400 crore investment and 18 months for the roll out, at a time when the sector is financially-stressed.

The timeline indicated by the industry body exceed the stipulated December deadline for operationalising the new system architecture.

COAI also rued that other markets had not prescribed such stringent requirements and obligations for operators.

TRAI's new UCC rules allow individuals to revoke permission that they have granted to any commercial entity for a service.

Subscribers can set preference about days and time bands on which they would like to receive commercial communications as well as indicate preferred modes of communication - call or SMS.

The rules lay down obligations for operators including evolving Code of Practices, maintaining records, and registering customer choice, and mandate the adoption of blockchain or the Distributed Ledger Technology. Blockchain provides a decentralised database or digital ledger of transactions that everyone on the network can see.

9,'Don't think a male child is safer than girls in any way',"A 28-year-old professional opens up about how being sexually abused as a boy impacted his speech, his confidence and altered his personality for life, and why it is important for survivors to speak up.
I am sure it is very difficult for a girl to speak up, but let me tell you, it is as tough or probably tougher if you are a boy. I have felt helpless and alone in my emotional battle against the trauma of sexual abuse as a child. The sense of shame was very intense. I want to tell everyone reading my story that don't think the male child is safer than girls in any way.

I am a 28-year-old working professional and I want to share my story now because I want people to know that it is not your fault if someone has abused you. There is nothing to be ashamed of. I want people to speak up.

I was abused twice as a child. The first time it happened I was in class 7. The predator in my case was one of the boys in my class who stays in my locality in Mumbai. He was much older and physically stronger. He met me one afternoon near my home and forcefully took me to one of the buildings in the vicinity. There was nobody on the road, so I could not seek help. I was scared.

He took me to the top floor of the building and started rubbing his private parts against my buttocks. This continued for 5-10 minutes. Shocked at what was happening, I tried hard to get away, but he overpowered me. Before letting me go he warned me that I should not tell anybody about what had happened.



I returned home in a daze. I was scared and felt dirty. I was also feeling guilty as I questioned myself as to why I could not prevent the abuse. The fear was evident on my face when I returned home that day. My parents noticed the troubled expression on my face and asked me what had happened. I could not speak up out of fear and lied to them that all was well.

All these years later, I now realise, it was not my fault. I tell myself again and again that I tried my best to stop him but he was physically stronger than me.

The abuse changed my life. The trauma impacted my speech and I started to speak very fast after the incident. I changed as a person as I started losing confidence in myself and a deep sense of fear got instilled in me.

This changed the way people perceived me. I became more vulnerable as people would consider me to be timid and thought they could bully me.

I feel it was the timid personality that I acquired after the abuse that resulted in abuse the second time, as boys thought I was a soft target. I was in class 9, and in the middle of a class, when a classmate sitting next to me started abusing me. He would keep our school bags on either side so that nobody could see. He would then touch my private parts and would want me to touch his too. While I never touched him and was able to somehow prevent that, unfortunately, I could not stop him from touching me.

This continued for 3-4 days and each day he would demand something more like he would touch me with my clothes on and gradually he would want me to allow him to touch me directly. 

Traumatised by the whole experience I somehow managed to change my place in class and starting sitting elsewhere. He never touched me again. Although this episode of abuse happened in class, I was unable to raise my voice. Lack of confidence in my ability to defend myself stopped me from speaking up. I thought if I complained my classmate would bully me.

The abuse led to further deterioration in my speech. I developed a stammer. I developed a chronic skin infection. My confidence dropped to an all-time low. I started fearing boys. The problem persists even in adulthood. I don't change clothes in the presence of other boys or men. I don't go to male doctors if I have to undergo a physical examination. I feel more comfortable around girls and women. I have more female friends than male friends. I feel safe in the presence of women.

The fear and apprehension have somewhat reduced over the years but it is still a problem. I am a working professional and have started taking measures to deal with the scars of abuse. I am taking one step at a time. My speech and confidence have improved after I started therapy.

Many times I feel I should have told my parents when I was abused for the first time. They would have reported the matter and the boy who abused me would have been punished. Both boys who abused me live in the same neighbourhood as me.

I want to tell my parents about my plight but I still have to muster the courage to speak to them. Last year, I opened up about the abuse for the first time and spoke to two of my very close female friends. I felt that my male friends will not understand if I spoke to them. However, I could not bring myself to share all the details with my female friends too.

As I speak now, I am reflecting deeply on what happened to me and sharing it here so that others don't suffer like me.

Each time I see the two men who abused me in my locality I feel very angry, but now I have decided to let go. I want to tell people that abuse is not a momentary incident. It is a crime that changes life, so don't ignore it, please speak up.

10,Article 35-A: Complete shutdown in Kashmir,"SRINAGAR: Life in Kashmir today came to a standstill due to a complete shutdown called by separatists against the legal challenge in the Supreme Court on the validity of Article 35-A, which bars people from outside Jammu and Kashmir from acquiring any immovable property in the state.

The situation across the valley is peaceful with no untoward incident reported from anywhere so far, officials said.

Shops and business establishments were closed across the Valley while all kinds of transport remained off the roads due to the strike called.

The Joint Resistance Leadership (JRL) has called for a two-day strike -- today and tomorrow -- as Supreme Court is scheduled to hear a PIL challenging the validity of the Article 35-A tomorrow.

The state government has filed an application before the Registrar of the Supreme Court, informing that it is going to seek adjournment of the hearing of the petition in view of the ""ongoing preparations for the upcoming Panchayat and urban local body and municipal elections in the state"".

The officials said security forces have been deployed in strength at vulnerable places in the city and elsewhere in Kashmir for maintaining law and order.

11,Nitish launches scheme for girl child post Muzaffapur sex scandal,"PATNA: Amid a barrage of attacks over the Muzaffarpur sex scandal, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has launched an ambitious scheme which promises to provide Rs 54,100 from the birth of a girl child till she graduates.

Kumar launched the 'Mukhyamantri Kanya Utthan Yojana' here on Friday and expressed his government's resolve for empowerment of women.

In his launch speech, Kumar talked about his happiness over the start of the scheme, but at the same time said he was ""standing here with mixed feelings"" over the case of sex abuse at a state-funded girls' shelter home at Muzaffarpur"".

On the occasion, the chief minister also made several other announcements like increasing the amount under the 'Bicycle Yojna' from Rs 2500 to Rs 3000.

The scheme, launched by Nitish Kumar government in 2006, providing bicycles to school going girls, has won laurels in the country and abroad.

He also announced doubling the amount for purchase of sanitary napkin to Rs 300 from existing Rs 150 under the 'Kishori Swasthya Yojna.'

The ambitious 'Mukhyamantri Kanya Utthan Yojana' will be run by three departments — education, health and social welfare.

Giving details of the scheme, Kumar had said on birth of a girl child her family would get Rs 2000. After preparation of her Aadhaar card, the family would get an additional amount of Rs 1000.

If the family completes the whole range of immunisation within two years of a girl's birth, it will get a sum of Rs 2000.

After entry into class one in a school, a girl will get Rs 600 for purchase of uniform. Similarly, she will get Rs 700 for uniform in between class three to five and it will be scaled up to Rs 1000 when she reaches 6th to 8th standard and Rs 1500 in between 9th to 12th standard.

On clearance of Intermediate, a sum of Rs 10,000 will be given to encourage her to pursue higher education. For this, only unmarried girls are eligible.

After doing graduation, she will get Rs 25,000.

This will be applicable to married as well unmarried women of a family having only two girls.

A sum of Rs 7221 crore will be spend in a year on the programme.

State health minister Mangal Pandey told PTI that the scheme which provides incentive for completing immunisation within two years of birth will help in maintaining good health of girls.

Principal Secretary of Education R K Mahajan described the scheme as ""very progressive"" which would help lift female literacy and also combat child marriage and control population surge.

The list of the girls who have cleared the intermediate examination this year has been prepared and they will be given Rs 10,000 under this scheme, he said.

12,"Around 10,000 jobs to be created under National Health Protection Scheme","NEW DELHI: At least 10,000 new jobs will be created with the implementation of the Centre's ambitious Ayushman Bharat-National Health Protection Mission (AB-NHPM), which aims to provide a cover of Rs 5 lakh per family annually to 10 crore poor families, according to a government official.

Around one lakh Ayushman Mitras will be deployed at both private and government hospitals under the scheme to assist patients coming to health facilities to avail packages under the mission.

The Health Ministry has signed a pact with the Skill Development Ministry for the recruitment of 1 lakh 'Ayushman Mitras'.

""Each empanelled hospital will have an 'Ayushman Mitra' to assist patients and will coordinate with beneficiaries and the hospital. They will run a help desk, check documents to verify eligibility and enrolment to the scheme.

""Around one lakh Ayushman Mitra's will be deployed at both private and government hospitals under the scheme,"" the official said.

Also, the Union health ministry has launched a formal process to empanel public and private hospitals to achieve universal health coverage under the programme and as many as 20,000 private and government hospitals have been linked under the scheme, the official said.

The Centre is simultaneously carrying out beneficiary identification and under the process 80 per cent of beneficiaries, based on the Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC) data in the rural and more than 60 per cent in urban areas, have been identified.

Announced in the 2018 Budget, the AB-NHPM was touted as the 'world's largest government funded health care scheme'.

Also, all beneficiaries will be given letters having QR codes which will be scanned and a demographic authentication conducted for identification and to verify his or her eligibility to avail benefits under the scheme.

Further, the government recently clarified that NABH is not mandatory for hospitals to get empanelled under the scheme.

Also, the basic empanelment criteria allows empanelment of a hospital with a minimum of 10 beds, with the flexibility provided to the states to further relax this if required.

13,Article 35-A: Complete shutdown in Kashmir,"SRINAGAR: Life in Kashmir today came to a standstill due to a complete shutdown called by separatists against the legal challenge in the Supreme Court on the validity of Article 35-A, which bars people from outside Jammu and Kashmir from acquiring any immovable property in the state.


The situation across the valley is peaceful with no untoward incident reported from anywhere so far, officials said.

Shops and business establishments were closed across the valley while all kinds of transport remained off the roads due to the strike called.

The Joint Resistance Leadership (JRL) has called for a two-day strike - Sunday and Monday - as Supreme Court is scheduled to hear a PIL challenging the validity of the Article 35-A tomorrow.

The state government has filed an application before the Registrar of the Supreme Court, informing that it is going to seek adjournment of the hearing of the petition in view of the ""ongoing preparations for the upcoming Panchayat and urban local body and municipal elections in the state"".

The officials said security forces have been deployed in strength at vulnerable places in the city and elsewhere in Kashmir for maintaining law and order.

Various organisations included Bar Association, transporters and traders' bodies have extended support to the shutdown call of the JRL, comprising Syed Ali Shah Geelani, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Mohammad Yasin Malik.

14,New crop insurance reports 15% drop in coverage of farmers; states which gave debt waivers see bigger decline,"NEW DELHI: The Centre's flagship crop insurance scheme, launched from kharif (summer sown crop) season of 2016-17, has reported a 15 per cent decline in coverage of farmers in its second year (2017-18) and one of the key reasons for this dip is the loan waiver announced by certain states last year.


Data on new crop insurance scheme, shared by the government in Parliament during ongoing monsoon session, shows that the farmers' enrolment under it declined from 57.3 million in 2016-17 to 48.8 million in 2017-18 with Karnataka, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra reporting higher declines in terms of coverage of farmers.

Incidentally, four of these five states - Karnataka, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra - launched their loan waiver schemes last year, affecting the footprint of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) during 2017-18.

Giving reasons for the dip, the agriculture ministry in its written response to a Parliament question in Rajya Sabha on Friday said, ""This is mainly due to factors like announcement of debt waiver scheme in Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, farmer's perception of mitigated risk in 2017-18 which was a good monsoon year, de-duplication due to Aadhaar being made mandatory for coverage etc..""

Records show that UP, Maharashtra and Karnataka had announced their loan waiver schemes before the cut-off date for receipt of proposals of farmers for getting insurance for kharif crops under the PMFBY in 2017. Similarly, Rajasthan had announced it before the Rabi sowing season last year.

Karnataka has reported highest percentage decline (40 per cent) in the number of farmer applicants followed by Rajasthan (34 per cent), UP (22 per cent), Bihar (18 per cent) and Maharashtra (16 per cent). 

The fall in coverage in Bihar can, however, be explained by the state's resistance to PMFBY. Though it had opted for it in 2016-17, it developed cold feet the next year after facing delays in disbursal of claims to farmers in the first year of the scheme.

Figures, shared by the ministry in Parliament, show that overall premium and claims under the PMFBY, however, increased in 2017-18 as compared to 2016-17 despite decline in its coverage to farmers during the period.

The gross premium (shares of farmers, central government and state governments) had increased from Rs 165 billion in kharif 2016 to Rs 195 billion in kharif 2017 while the approved claims increased from Rs 104 billion to Rs 137 billion during the period.

However, the payment of claims did not increase at the same pace. Insurance companies had paid nearly Rs 102 billion to farmers as against the approved claims of Rs 104 billion for kharif 2016. But for Kharif 2017, only Rs 118 billion has, so far, been paid to farmers against the approved claims of Rs 137 billion, a clear indication that delay in disbursal of claims has become the biggest bottleneck in successful implementation of PMFBY.

Seeking to overcome this problem, the ministry has decided to bring some reforms where the insurance companies will have to pay the claim with 12% interest if they fail to clear it within two months. Even the state governments will have to pay interest to farmers if they (states) delay their shares of premium.

15,No use of quota without jobs: Nitin Gadkari,"Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari on Saturday said reservation to Marathas or any community is not the solution to a problem and job creation is the need of the hour.


“The solution is generation of employment and increasing the per capita income. Even if we give reservation, there are no jobs. Government has stopped recruitment even in banks because many tasks have been taken over by information technology,” said the minister.

Gadkari was speaking to reporters after attending a meeting in Aurangabad to review projects related to roads and highways. “While considering reservation for a community, a thought should also be given to a particular class from each community that do not even have food or clothes,” he said.

Meanwhile, in Pune, NCP leader Sharad Pawar on Saturday said the government should not disturb the SC, ST and OBC quotas while giving reservation to the Maratha community. “The government doesn’t want to take any concrete decision about the Maratha reservation. It wants to unite other communities’ organizations to isolate the Maratha protesters. By doing so, it will gain political mileage. But this will create unrest in the society. Instead, the government should rope in respected people, whom the agitators will listen to,” he said.

16,"Snag in Air India rostering system sends duty messages to retired, quit and dead crew members","NEW DELHI: Almost five years after quitting as an Air India airhostess, Meera Bhatia* earlier this week received a message from the airline’s crew rostering system informing her that she had to operate a certain flight. Then Bhatia (name changed on request) received almost 40 mails in a duration of 48 hours informing her of several changes of flights that she had to operate.


Bhatia was not alone. Hundreds of crew members who had retired or had quit AI have been receiving such messages and mails this week from the airline’s automated crew management system (CMS). Thanks to an error which took it back to an old software that had the inactive members' numbers. Quite naturally, some of these communications landed in inboxes of now-deceased crew members and were read by their family members who still use those email accounts, say sources.

“It has been nearly five years since I quit my job at AI … I still miss my crew life and whenever I am travelling I feel like I could get out of my seat and still seamlessly launch into conducting the service if I had to… shall I borrow a uniform and report to (work),” said a Facebook post of an ex crew member.

An AI spokesman said mails for reporting to duty went to retired crew members and those who had quit due to an error in the system. “The snag was resolved on Friday morning,” said the spokesman. “Rostering is done entirely by CMS. An old version of CMS which was no longer in use was wrongly used due to a problem in the system. This led to ex crew members wrongly getting these messages,” said the spokesman.

Some retired employees called up the CMS and informed them of the error. Even some serving crew members were sent mails, wrongly informing of change in flights assigned. When such people got in touch with crew management, they were sent messages saying: “Dear crew, due to system updation, automatic email/notification has been generated. You are requested to ignore the same and follow the flight assignment as per (schedule).” Luckily the number of in-service crew members who got these mails was small and did not lead affect flights.

The snag in cabin crew rostering system comes even as the rostering of pilots is under the scanner following complaints of malpractices. Senior staffers responsible for preparing pilots' roster are being probed after allegations that rosters are being changed at the insistence of some pilots. Pilots were allegedly using flexibility in flying hours to pocket extra allowances. Sources said some pilots mutually decide among themselves on flight duties. One pilot would fly 40 hours and take the allowances for 70 hours by playing with the system.

The head master of the government-run residential school at Sikhpalli was arrested today on the basis of a note found in a notebook of the deceased, Superintendent of Police Jagmohan Meena said.

Her note accused the headmaster of being involved in sexual assault of minor girls in the school.

20,"Now, startups let city folk play real Farmville","Swamyraj Kulkarni, 40, had never sown a plant in his life. But the yearning for fresh, chemical-free subzi made the IT professional turn farmer in March. The experience has been “eye-opening”, he says. “Now, I know what I eat and grow what I eat.”


But Kulkarni didn’t quit his job and take to the plough. He simply signed up with the startup Farmizen and rented a 600sq-ft plot near his home in north Bengaluru to grow organic vegetables. Every fortnight, he visits the farm with his fiveyear-old daughter and eight-year-old son to work with his farmer-partner Prithvi, who looks after the crops in his absence. There’s also an app that lets him track the status of his crops, and barter excess vegetables with members living nearby.


A number of other initiatives are also taking the headache out of farming. In Delhi, Kapil Mandawewala’s startup Edible Routes, which helps people set up kitchen gardens, has started offering a 2,400sq ft ‘farmlet’ with a free workshop and fortnightly veggie delivery for six months for Rs 29,992. “A terrace is never going to be enough to grow the majority of your food requirements,” he points out. “This also creates a community of like-minded people who are conscious about how they live and eat.”

Gurugram’s Mayuri Sharma signed up with Edible Routes after being unsuccessful in growing vegetables at home due to lack of sunlight. “It is not easy to access organic food yet, and this is also more cost-effective in the long run,” says Sharma, 35. Also, having spent her childhood amidst kitchen gardens, she wanted her three-year-old daughter to grow up knowing the “delight of getting your own gajar and mooli”.

Launched last July, Farmizen has a small but growing subscriber base of over 800 members spread across 14 farms. Founder Shameek Chakravarty, who hit upon the idea after his own stint with farming, says the biggest draw for customers is trust. “In a survey, 67% of our customers said they didn’t trust what was being sold in the market. This is directly farm to fork,” says Chakravarty.

Social enterprise Indian Superheroes is also planning to launch a similar farm app in Chennai, after getting an enthusiastic response to farming workshops in Coimbatore, where participants could rent a farm for a trial month.

Since models and prices vary, it’s difficult to tell whether these services are actually cheaper than buying organic produce. Subscribers of Farmizen pay a monthly fee of Rs 2,500 in return for leasing a 600sq ft plot which yields an average of 5-6kg of vegetables every week.

For Rs 60,000 a year, Delhi’s Organic Maati provides a one-acre plot for a year, and a supply of organic pulses, grains and vegetables, divided equally between the subscriber and the startup.

Yet Deepak Gupta, a banker who founded Organic Maati in 2016, says that urban farmers are also drawn to the experience itself. “It is about the joy of farming in its raw form, with fresh air, the sound of birds chirping, no gadgets, highrises and industries, and plenty of exercise, rather than just consuming the food delivered to your doorstep,” says Gupta.

Subscriber Saurabh Thirani simply wanted to connect with nature. “People like me who work in a fancy office for an MNC feel that gap in our lives even more acutely,” says the Gurugram-based CA, who visits his farm every weekend.

One of the aims is to help city dwellers understand where their food is coming from and foster a closer relationship between them and farmers. The ventures also claim to help farmers get a regular income and a bigger share of the sales by cutting out middlemen, besides encouraging natural farming methods without pesticides and chemical fertilisers. For example, Farmizen has a 50-50 revenue-sharing arrangement with farmers. Chennai’s Valam Organics focuses on community farming, where members share costs, work load, and the harvest based on initial investment. Valam, which focuses on local crop varieties of paddy and pulses, leases land from farmers who, in turn, get a monthly salary and a portion of the yield.

“Farmers get the worst deal in the economic pyramid. If we buy vegetables for Rs 50 a kilo, the farmer gets Rs 2. They are misled by companies into buying irrelevant equipment, seeds, fertilisers and get into a debt trap. The only way to solve this was by giving them financial security,” says Gupta of Organic Maati, which employs landless migrant farmers on a fixed income.

One of them, Phool Chand, 28, from Barabanki in UP, came to Delhi after his family was forced to sell off most of their land in the village. “I earn more money and have a place to stay. The new job has helped me increase my monthly savings by Rs 3,000,” he says.Now, startups let city folk play real Farmville

21,"Ensure Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme is free of fraud, Modi tells officials","NEW DELHI: Days ahead of the launch of the ambitious Ayushman Bharat insurance scheme, Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged officials to ensure the scheme is not tarred by fraud and pointed out that the approaching election season will mean smallest slips will be highlighted.


The Ayushman Bharat national health protection scheme (NHPS), often referred to as “Modicare”, will roll out in 12 states in the first phase beginning August 15 and will be completed by October 2.

""Take all kind of strong measures to prevent fraud and misuse of the scheme,"" Modi is understood to have urged officials at a high level review of the scheme’s preparedness. The PM said with elections at hand, mistakes or shortcomings are likely to be magnified and one needs to be ""extra careful”.

The PM also gave some suggestions for the logo, which is expected to be launched in a week. Besides, he asked health ministry to pay particular attention to ensuring that hospitals empanelled under the scheme maintain cleanliness and hygiene. 

Modi is also expected to announce the scheme from Red Fort during his Independence Day address. The review, which went on for more than 90 minutes on Saturday morning, was attended by top officials from the health ministry, Niti Aayog and PMO.

Modicare aims to cover nearly 50 crore beneficiaries from over 10.74 crore “deprived” families as per socio-economic and caste census (SECC) data with an annual health cover of Rs 5 lakh per family. .

States where the insurance scheme will be rolled out in the first phase include Chhattisgarh, Assam, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Nagaland, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and most Union Territories. In the first leg, about three crore families with 15 crore individuals will be covered, an official told TOI.

So far the Centre has signed memorandum of understanding (MoUs) with 26 states, whereas four more - Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan and Goa - are expected to come on board by next week. Some 6,000 hospitals have applied for empanelment so far.

The National Health Agency, the implementation agency for the scheme, has so far identified 10 crore families. “The verification process is going on and while some families are likely to have migrated since 2011 when the census was done, we have their names and they can come and claim benefits,” NHA chief Indu Bhushan said.

The NHA has also called for a meeting of chief secretaries and IT heads from all the 26 states over the weekend to work out the modalities and do dry runs before the final launch. The identification and verification process has been carried out through Gram Swaraj Abhiyan camps under Ayushman Bharat Diwas and through ASHA workers in three lakh villages.

While a total of 65 lakh families are yet to be identified under the beneficiary identification system, Uttar Pradesh has the most 23.61 lakh or 36% of missing families, followed by Bihar with 21.79 lakh or 34%. All the other states together have 19.45 lakh families missing from the list.

23,"Rahul, Kejriwal join RJD’s Jantar Mantar rally, but avoid being in same frame","NEW DELHI: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and Congress president Rahul Gandhi used the same platform- protest against mass rapes at a government-assisted women shelter in Bihar- at Jantar Mantar here on Saturday, but dodged each other to ensure that they don’t figure in the same photo frame. 


While Kejriwal took the stage at around 6 pm, Gandhi came to the venue around 7.15 pm. Leaders of RJD, who organized the protest of opposition parties against NDA, had no illusion that their exhortation for putting up a show of unity will not succeed in bringing the Congress chief and Delhi CM together.

“Rahul Gandhi won’t share the dais with Kejriwal and vice versa in Delhi. He (Gandhi) will come only after Kejriwal addresses the gathering and leaves the venue,” said a RJD source hours in advance.

The pain they took to keep distance from each other was yet another proof that while the imperative of taking on the dominant BJP may impel them to occasionally be on the same platform, Congress and AAP are not ready to bury the hatchet in Delhi: a factor which may see 3-way fight in the capital, featuring them and the saffron party.

While the Delhi CM has shown no appetite for tactical understanding, Delhi unit of Congress seems to be equally averse to the idea of putting up a united front against BJP which swept the 7 seats in the city in 2014. 

Despite the efforts of opposition parties to join hands against BJP, Delhi may still witness a three-way battle in the parliamentary elections. Congress appears reluctant to join hands with AAP in the capital in the face of strong opposition from its state unit headed by Ajay Maken.

Top Congress sources said state units are “the starting points for any talk on alliances” and their views could not be ignored.

In case of Delhi, AICC noted that its state unit was bitterly opposed to any truck with chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. “We cannot ignore this strong view,” a senior AICC office-bearer said.

Sources said Congress would also not join hands with the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi in Telangana because the state Congress is in direct contest with the local outfit.

The leadership’s position on Delhi comes despite pressure from other opposition leaders, including TMC chief Mamata Banerjee, that Congress should ally with AAP to defeat BJP.

Prior to Saturday, Gandhi and Kejriwal shared the dais twice — first to celebrate the defeat of BJP in Bihar in 2015 and then in Bengaluru at the swearing-n ceremony of HD Kumaraswamy.

However, in the home (Delhi) turf, AAP Congress are still political adversaries and both leaders kept the distance.

24,United they stand: Opposition parties join RJD protest,"NEW DELHI: “If one Nirbhaya can bring down the UPA government, 40 girls can topple 40 governments,” warned Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, expressing his solidarity at the protest called by RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav against the Bihar government for the Muzaffarpur shelter rapes. 


Kejriwal’s strong words, however, held a political irony as Congress chief Rahul Gandhi also shared the stage and the Nirbhaya case had proved a waterloo for UPA in terms of its image. But this was a minor ruffle on a day when opposition parties united over the demand for action against those guilty of rape of girls at a shelter home in Muzaffarpur, with Tejashwi calling the situation in Bihar as “Rakshas Raj”.

Rahul Gandhi said the country is witnessing a dangerous trend “where everyone who is weak is under attack”. Opposition leaders across party-lines demanded resignation of Bihar CM Nitish Kumar. JD(U) had appealed to Congress and Kejriwal to keep away from the protest but its words had little effect. 

Attacking the Centre and Bihar government and giving an “ultimatum” of 30 days to bring the culprits to book, Kejriwal said the Nitish Kumar government “continued to look the other way despite knowing what was happening with the children at the shelter home for months”. 

Warning BJP that people will not spare it if action is not taken against the culprits, Kejriwal said: “Even after things were brought to light by NGOs and other government agencies, the government continued to fund and refused to initiate action.”

The Delhi CM said it is clear that perpetrators had connections with top officials and political leaders. “I demand in three months the guilty should be hanged, no mater to which party they belong and how big they are,” he said, adding the issue was not one of politics. He criticised BJP for its “attitude” towards women, saying even foreign minister Sushma Swaraj was not spared (in social media over the Lucknow passport case). The protest was attended by Left leaders like Sitaram Yechury and D Raja besides representatives of Samajwadi Party, TMC and RLD among others.

25,Congress Hopes To Protect Its Vote Bank: BJP Chief,"KANKROLI: BJP president Amit Shah on Saturday lashed out at Congress chief Rahul Gandhi on the NRC issue and demanded that he clear his stand on whether Bangladeshis who had infiltrated into India should be deported back to their country.


“Congress hopes to protect its vote bank. Ask Rahul ‘baba’ when he comes to Rajasthan — should not the Bangladeshi infiltrators be deported back? Should NRC be implemented or not; should the Bangladeshi infiltrators live in the country or not?” Shah said while addressing a huge gathering here to kickstart BJP’s campaign for the Rajasthan assembly polls.

Shah said the Modi government had initiated the screening for illegal Bangladeshis which Congress is objecting to. “BJP, Modi government does not act on the basis of vote banks. There is an SC order. We will implement it. Hum unko chinhit kar hi chhodenge (We will ensure that illegal migrants are identified),” he said.

Shah said he heard that Congress leaders had raised 40 questions for Rajasthan CM Vasundhara Raje. “Rahul baba too is demanding to know what we have done in the last four years. People in the country want an account of your four generations,” he said.

“Under the UPA government, Rajasthan was allotted Rs 1,09,000 crore while under Modi, it has been allotted Rs 2,63,000 crore,” Shah said.Shah said the allegation that BJP had diluted the SC/ ST Act was a lie. “It was an SC order and BJP worked towards strengthening the SC/ST Act,” he said.

26,Locals back doctors who were asked to move out for being Muslim,"KOLKATA: The four city doctors, who were asked to vacate a rented flat at Kudghat because of their religious identity, will continue to stay there.


Sanghati Abhijan — the volunteer group which came forward to help Aftab Alam and his friends — has sorted the issue by talking to locals, their landlord and the family members of the neighbour who opposed their stay.

When TOI spoke to the neighbour, he said it was a “small” matter and those young doctors, being immature, made a big issue out of it. “I didn’t make any communal statement, nor did I intend to hurt anyone’s religious sentiment. It was only for the security of the apartment that I wanted their ID cards.” However, he added that he was against the stay of four bachelors in and the same would be discussed at the evening meeting so that further misunderstandings do not occur. Since Thursday, TOI has been flooded with calls from people, who want to help resolve the issue. 

Alam said, “We will stay as other neighbours have stood by us. Also, our landlord did not have any problem so we have decided not to shift.”

27,Congress: BJP using NRC for ‘communal polarisation’,"NEW DELHI: Congress on Saturday accused BJP of a “diabolic agenda” to use the National Register of Citizens for communal polarisation and raised questions over the NRC’s exclusions even as it reiterated that the exercise is riddled with anomalies.


Congress claimed that it has aggressively pursued identification of illegal migrants but added that exclusion of 40 lakh residents from the register was marred by inaccuracies and BJP is attempting to divert attention from the “colossal failures” of the Modi government.

The Congress articulation on NRC came out more forcefully at a marathon discussion of the Congress Working Committee which had specially invited party MPs from Assam, including the state unit president and legislature party leader, to hear their views on the issue.

The CWC meeting also decided to launch a “public campaign” on Rafale deal to highlight what it called corruption in the Modi government and discussed “state of economy and lack of jobs”. “One of the highlights of today’s CWC meeting, was Mr Antony’s brilliant description of the Rafale robbery: 130,000 Cr. stolen from the people of India and given to a friend who was 45,000 crore in debt,” Rahul Gandhi tweeted.

During the discussion on Assam, former CM Tarun Gogoi argued he not only initiated the NRC process but also got the state electoral list scrutinised twice. Sources quoted him as saying that all those in the electoral list should be in the NRC.

In what appeared a riposte, state Congress chief Ripun Bora said doing so will give an impression that there were no illegal migrants. Gogoi clarified he was only underlining that he had reviewed the electoral rolls twice before holding the elections.

Congress spokesman Randeep Surjewala said the NRC was started by UPA and Tarun Gogoi regime in Assam completed 80% of the exercise.

“Congress supports the NRC process. But there are multiple anomalies in the final draft NRC list, leaving out 40 lakh persons comprising indigenous Assamese people, Hindu Bengalis, Nepalis, Gorkhas, Tea Tribes, religious minorities, Indian citizens from other states.” Surjewala also distributed Parliament questions to say UPA deported 82,728 persons to Bangladesh between 2005-13 while Modi government had only deported 1,822 from 2014-17.

28,Mehul Choksi clean chit: Mumbai police start probe,"NEW DELHI: A day after a police verification report giving clean chit to fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi sparked a controversy, the Mumbai police brass ordered an enquiry to find out if there were any lapses in the process even as senior Congress leader P Chidambaram wondered how the diamond merchant could have fled the country despite being under investigation since 2016.


The Mumbai police on Saturday defended its verification procedures for passport, saying that the criminal antecedents and information system (CAIS), used to check the criminal record of an applicant in a particular police station area, didn’t throw up any “criminal” on Choksi as he had never been arrested.

“On February 23, 2017, Mehul Choksi had applied for getting police clearance certificate (PCC) to RPO (regional passport office), Mumbai. The next day, Personal Particular Form was downloaded by Malabar Hill police station for verification. On March 10, 2017, the Malabar Hill police station submitted a clear report i.e. no criminal antecedents against Mehul Choksi...” the Mumbai police said in a statement on Saturday. The report was forwarded to RPO on March 14, 2017, by passport branch SB-II, CID, Mumbai police. 

The police said the CAIS reflects the applicant’s name only if he has been arrested in any offence. At the time of issuance of Choksi’s passport in 2015 too, “no police verification status was granted by RPO Mumbai”, so no police verification (PVR) was generated by the city police, the statement added.

29,Newly-laid stretch of NH-24 caves in,"BAREILLY: A portion of the newly-constructed Bareilly-Sitapur stretch of the NH-24 caved in after heavy rains on Friday. The NHAI restricted movement of vehicles on the highway. The stretch, opened to public in April, became the second such incident this week after a portion of the Agra-Lucknow expressway caved in on Wednesday. 


Mukesh Sharma, project director, NHAI, told TOI, “Incessant rains over the past couple of days led to a major portion on one side of the highway caving in along with major cracks elsewhere.” 

NHAI terminated its contract with Era Infra Engineering Limited, the firm which was assigned construction of the 157km Bareilly-Sitapur stretch of NH-24, on Saturday. NHAI said the firm had stopped construction for several months without giving any information to the authority and made no reply to notices issued to it over the past three monthss.

The firm’s owner, Delhi-based industrialist Hem Singh Bharana, 55, is facing a multi-agency probe by CBI, ED and others for allegedly duping several leading Indian banks and other lending institutions to the tune of over Rs 10,000 crore. He has been accused of borrowing money from banks, defaulting payments and laundering money. 

“To complete the remaining work, we are going to initiate the procedure to float fresh tenders. Besides, the company will also be blacklisted,” Sharma said.

30,Indore civic body to track officials with GPS watches,"INDORE: Indore Municipal Corporation is gifting watches to heads of departments — to keep an eye on them. These watches are GPS-enabled and will help the municipal commissioner keep track of where officials are, and how much time they spend in office. And yes, they show time, too.


These watches will be handed out by the second week of August but most officials have no clue to it. It will be mandatory for all heads of all departments to wear these watches between 10.30am and 5.30pm — the official working hours.

IMC commissioner Asheesh Singh told TOI that the GPS watches will be compulsory for all additional commissioners, deputy commissioners, executive engineers and assistant engineers of IMC.

The smart watch will upload essential details — like when the official entered office and how much time they were at work or in the field — to the commissioner’s dashboard,” Singh said, adding: “Of course, they will show time and have inbuilt cameras as well.”

“The objective of these watches include prevention of misuse of manual attendance system, and maintaining transparency and accountability in day-to-day work,” Singh said.

Asked how the civic staff would take to it, senior officers told TOI that the HoDs may not have any problem, but middle and lower-level staff could resist if it trickles down to them. 

Singh’s aim is improve administrative efficiency, officials said.

Initially, Indore Municipal Corporation is procuring 300 watches and will pay Rs 300 per year for each, say sources. A central government undertaking, called ITI, will provide these smart watches and end-to-end solutions. Live tracking of the person wearing it is very much possible, said an official. 

“The geo-fencing function of this watch is far more precise than mobile phones,” he explained, adding that Nagpur Municipal Corporation has already introduced these watches under its cleanliness campaign and the idea was appreciated at national level. 


These watches will be handed out by the second week of August but most officials have no clue to it. It will be mandatory for all heads of all departments to wear these watches between 10.30am and 5.30pm — the official working hours.

The other two elevations to the SC include Chief Justice of Orissa High Court Vineet Saran and Madras HC Chief Justice Indira Banerjee. With Justice Banerjee’s elevation, the apex court will for the first time have three women judges in its 68-year-old history. 

The government has also notified appointment of Chief Justices of the High Courts of Orissa, Jharkhand, Madras, Delhi, J&K and Patna.

Justice Gita Mittal, the acting Chief Justice of Delhi High Court, has been appointed as the Chief Justice of the J&K High Court, becoming the first woman chief justice to head the HC.

Justice Aniruddha Bose, a judge of the Calcutta HC, has been elevated as the chief justice of the Jharkhand HC. He was earlier recommended by the SC collegium for taking over as the CJ of the Delhi HC which the government had returned seeking reconsideration of the collegium on the grounds that being a big HC, it needs an experienced judge to head it.

Justice Rajendra Menon, the Chief Justice of the Patna High Court, has been posted as the new Chief Justice of the Delhi HC; Justice Kalpesh Satyendra Jhaveri, a judge of the Rajasthan HC, has been elevated as the Chief Justice of the Orissa HC in place of Justice Vineet Saran who has been elevated to the Supreme Court.

32,Man beaten to death over suspicion of cattle theft,"Around 2 km outside the tiny hamlet of Bahrola in Haryana’s Palwal, the blood stains are still evident under the neem tree where a man was tied up and beaten to death in the early hours of Friday. The 25-year-old was allegedly lynched here by a mob of more than 25-30 people on suspicion of cattle theft.


Three brothers, Bir Singh, Prakash and Ram Kishan, are the prime accused in the case. Family members, however, say that another two dozen villagers also participated in the beating of alleged thief. “Would you not retaliate if someone comes to steal in your house?” says Santra Devi the wife of accused Bir Singh.

In the courtyard of the house, where the lynching took place, half a dozen calves and buffaloes are still tied up even as villagers come to make inquiries and even show solidarity. Balesh, wife of another accused Ramkishan, narrated her version of the incident. “Around 3.30 am on Friday, 3 thieves were trying to cut the mosquito nets under which the cattle were kept. Our husbands woke up and tried to catch them. Two escaped, but we caught hold of one of them,” Balesh added. The unidentified victim was then tied up and beaten by the gathered mob during hours. “When we called the police around 5am, he was still alive. Police arrived around 7.00am but didn’t take him to hospital. Doctors arrived later and it was only around 9am that the body was taken away from here,” Santra Devi claimed.

Naresh Kumar, a neighbor who works at a car-wash in Faridabad, said that he only came to know about the incident in the morning. “By the time I reached, the man was already dead. Crowd had beaten him blue and there were marks of his hands and legs being tied.”

The Gujjar-dominated village of Bahrola has around 150-200 families whose primary occupation is farming and cattle rearing. The anger at cattle thieves and police inaction is palpable. “So many gangs of cattle thieves are operating in the area. There have been three thefts in the last 10 days alone. If police do nothing, what do you expect villagers to do?” says Suman Devi, another villager. Villagers claimed that similar cases of cattle thefts were happening in neighboring villages of Phulwari, Silouthi and Bamni khera. 

“Similar pattern was seen during these months in last year. Cattle thieves, wearing knickers and soaked in oil, get active as soon as crops attain a certain height. Calls to police always go unanswered,” said Jeet Ram, another villager whose cattle were stolen 8 days back. 

‘Internal bleeding in the intestine’, and ‘shock and hemorrhage’ have been identified as the cause of death in the initial post mortem report and the deceased has received 15 major internal injuries, investigative officer Suresh Kumar said. “He seems an outsider and not from this region. There was no identity document on him. We have issued his pictures in newspapers. Hopefully we will get some clue soon,” Kumar added. He denied allegations that police reached the spot late.

SHO Sadar police station Devender Singh said police had ruled out the case to be a religiously motivated crime. “One accused is under custody and we will soon nab other two,” Kumar added.

33,"Rahul hits out at Nitish, may have shut door on tie-up","NEW DELHI: With Congress president Rahul Gandhi joining the protest of RJD’s GenNext, Tejashwi Yadav, that targeted Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar for the “Muzaffarpur rapes”, Congress seems to be finally giving up on JD(U) chief as a potential partner.


Despite appeals from JD(U) that Congress stay away from the RJD protest at Jantar Mantar in the capital, Rahul not only showed up but cited the presence of political leaders on the dais as a picture of uniting opposition. More importantly, he took on Nitish Kumar by saying that if he was really ashamed of the incident, he should take expeditious action against the accused.



Kejri, Yechury, Yadav join rape protest

Young Yadav was at his relentless best against Kumar, his bête-noire, setting the tone for the protest which was joined by AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal, CPM leader Sitaram Yechury and JD(U) rebel Sharad Yadav, among others.

The frame at Jantar Mantar came despite the fact that Kumar’s emissaries have been in touch with Congress over his restiveness with ally BJP: an overture which some in Congress seemed eager to reciprocate in order to prevent the saffron party from repeating its sweep of 40 LS seats in 2014.

JD(U) won the assembly elections in partnership with RJD and Congress, but last year quit the alliance and joined hands with BJP. Since the break-up, Yadav has kept up a strong onslaught against Kumar and repeatedly said that RJD’s doors were shut on “dhokhebaaz chacha”. Saturday’s protest suggested that Congress too may be veering towards RJD’s position on JD(U). Unlike RJD, Congress has believed that despite the “betrayal”, the opposition would notch a strong political gain in the perception war against BJP ahead of the 2019 elections if Kumar switched sides again.

Weakening BJP is more important, ran Congress’s argument, than smarting under Kumar’s “betrayal”.

34,"Chandrayaan-2 launch put off: India, Israel in lunar race for 4th position","NEW DELHI: India’s most ambitious Chandrayaan-2 mission, which was earlier scheduled for October first week, has been postponed till December, according to an Isro source. The mission, which was originally scheduled for April 23 this year, has been deferred for the second time. With Israel too planning to launch a moon mission in December, it will be a race between Tel Aviv and New Delhi for the fourth position in the world to land on the moon. Till now, US, Russia and China have been able to soft-land its spacecraft on the mission’s surface.


Unlike the Chandrayaan-1 programme in 2008 that involved only orbiting around the moon, Chandrayaan-2 is a much complicated mission as it involves an orbiter, a lander and a rover. The mission involves a soft-landing on the lunar surface and a rover that will walk and analysis the content on the moon’s surface. Being India’s most challenging mission, Isro doesn’t want to take chances and taking time to fix all glitches in the lunar mission. The reason Isro is treading cautiously with this high-profile mission is because it had witnessed two satellite mission failures in the last one year — navigation satellite IRNSS-1H got stuck in the heat shield during its launch last August and Gsat-6A communication satellite went out of control after it was launched in April this year.

As the weight of the Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft has increased, according to the source, GSLV Mk III or Isro’s ‘fat boy’ will now carry the spacecraft as it has the lifting capability of over four tonne. According to the earlier plan, GSLV Mk II which just three-tonne lifting capability was supposed to carry the payload.

Israeli nonprofit SpaceIL and Israel Aerospace Industries will launch its mission to the moon by the end of this year. Describing its mission, SpaceIL, in a video, said it involved a 1,300-pound lander piggybacking on an Elon Musk-owned SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, whose primary payload is a communications satellite. The spacecraft will orbit the moon for almost two months before landing, where it will record and send video and conduct some small science observations using a magnetometer.

Describing India’s Chandrayaan-2 mission, the Isro chairman had earlier told TOI, “It is totally an indigenous programme. All components of the Chandrayaan-2 mission, including an orbiter, a lander and a rover, have been developed in the country. There integration is going on and they all are undergoing rigorous tests. On reaching the moon’s orbit, the lander will get detached from the orbiter and soft-land on the lunar surface. The six-wheeled rover fixed within the lander will get detached and move on the lunar surface for around 100 metres. It will spend 14 Earth days (one moon day) and analyse the content. It will also take photos of the moon’s surface and relay the images back to the Earth via the orbiter within 15 minutes.”

35,Central and state governments sit over 24 lakh vacancies amid debate over job drought,"In time of a raging debate over jobless growth, nearly 24 lakh posts are lying vacant with the central and state governments, data compiled from answers to various questions in Parliament show.


A Rajya Sabha question answered on February 8 shows that the largest chunk is the over 10 lakh vacant positions for teachers in elementary (9 lakh) and secondary schools (1.1 lakh). 

Apart from the vacancies in the centrally sponsored Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, which provides assistance to states and Union territories to maintain the desired pupil-teacher ratio under right to education norms, the bulk of these vacancies are in the domain of the states and Union territory administrations.




A Lok Sabha question answered on March 27 quoting figures from the Bureau of Police Research & Development stated that there are 4.4 lakh vacancies in civil and district armed police.

The same source showed that an additional 90,000-odd positions vacant in state armed police, taking the total vacancy in police forces to 5.4 lakh across the country. 

Law and order being a state subject, these positions are primarily under the state governments.


Railways has 2.5L vacancies among non-gazetted staff 
Incidentally, among major economies, India has one of the lowest police-to-population ratios. This is often held to be a major factor in larger law-and-justice issues like pendency of cases and lower conviction rates because of slapdash investigations done by overburdened police. It is not surprising that the judiciary, with crores of pending cases, is also running well below full strength. A Lok Sabha question answered on July 18 points at over 5,800 vacancies in courts.

Answers to Rajya Sabha questions on March 14 and 19 and a Lok Sabha question on April 4 showed that there are over 1.2 lakh vacant positions in the defence services and paramilitary forces. Over 61,000 of these are in paramilitary forces while the aggregate figure for the three defence forces is over 62,000.

Then there are 2.5 lakh vacant posts among non-gazetted staff in the railways, the answer to a Rajya Sabha question on March 16 revealed. It, however, stated that two notifications have been issued in February to fill more than 89,000 of these vacancies.

A Lok Sabha question answered on March 28 points at over 54,000 vacancies in the postal department, another major government employer.

The health sector is another casualty of vacancies in sanctioned positions. A Rajya Sabha question answered on February 6 shows that there are about 1.5 lakh vacancies in these centres. About 16,000 are of doctors or specialists while others include nursing staff.

36,Discrepancies need not discredit child victims' depositions in sexual abuse cases: HC,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court today held that investigating agencies can record multiple statements of a child victim of sexual abuse and a contradictory initial account of the incident would not be a reason to disbelieve subsequent versions by the minor.


A bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice Anu Malhotra said that the multiple statements should be carefully scrutinized by the trial courts to ensure that complete justice is done.

The bench said that children ""do not disclose in one go but do so in piece meal"".

The court also said that under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, which was enacted to effectively address sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children, a statement about the incident of sexual abuse can be made only to a police officer or a magistrate.

""Provisions of the POCSO Act or the Juvenile Justice Act do not contemplate any report to be made by a counsellor,"" the bench said.

It added that both laws make it ""explicitly clear"" that a report or notes of a counsellor or any person or expert recognized under the two Acts ""are confidential in nature and the same cannot be made a part of the charge sheet or otherwise (be included) on the trial court record"". 

The findings by the court came in response to a query by a Principal Magistrate of a Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) in 2016, regarding the legality of multiple statements by a child victim as well as the validity of the statements recorded by NGOs or counsellors.

Answering the queries raised by the JJB magistrate, the high court said, ""The law allows the investigating agencies to record multiple statements of the victims. There is no prohibition on recording multiple statements by the police. A seemingly contradictory initial account is not a reason in itself to disbelieve the subsequent accounts by the victims. 

""The multiple statements placed by the investigating agency should be carefully scrutinized by the trial courts in order to ensure that complete justice is done.""

Giving reasons for its finding, the bench said that children ""do not disclose in one go but do so in piece meal"". 

""To accord the same treatment to a child as one would to an adult would result in grave injustice. It needs no elaboration that the children would be reluctant and unlikely to disclose an entire adverse experience in proper detail in their first statement to the police, let alone the necessary details.

""The fear for themselves or their family; an apprehension that they would be disbelieved; inability to identify themselves as victims; pressure or threats from the perpetrator; relationship to the perpetrator; fear of embarrassment, shame or self-blame; fear of stigmatization; lack of trust with the investigating agency amongst other would be some of the reasons which would act as barriers to a child making a disclosure of a complete incident in a single meeting,"" the court said.

Regarding the legality of recording of the minor victim's statement by an NGO or counsellor, the court said that the POCSO Act clearly establishes that the child's account of the incident be recorded only by a police officer and/or a magistrate and not by any third party.

""The law has also clearly delineated specifically even the gender, attire, manner and the place at which such statement would be recorded,"" it said.

A close scrutiny of the legislation would show that the law does not anywhere envisage recording of a statement of child victim by a counsellor or a report of any kind from a counsellor about his/her interactions with the child, the bench added.

""It is trite that where law prescribes, the manner in which an act has to be performed, it has to be performed in that manner or not at all,"" the bench said and added that the role of a counsellor or an NGO representative was only to be present at the time of recording of statement, to assist the child and ""not assist in the investigation,"" the court said.

The court also said that reports of an NGO or a counsellor relating to a child in need of care and protection or in conflict with law ""are required to be treated as confidential"". 

""The confidentiality thus attached to the report by any person or expert is absolute. So far as the victim is concerned, other than the police or the magistrate, no person or authority is authorized to take any forensic interviews. 

""For this reason as well, it would be the grossest illegality for any of the person, experts and authorities under the POCSO Act or the JJ Act to make reports which could have any bearing on the case,"" it said.

37,"It's not 'jungle raj' but 'rakshas raj' in Bihar, alleges Tejashwi Yadav","NEW DELHI: RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav on Saturday tore into beleaguered Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, alleging that the Muzaffarpur incident has showed that there is not 'jungle raj' (misrule) but 'rakshas raj' (devil's rule) in the state.


The Leader of Opposition in the Bihar Assembly was addressing a gathering at Jantar Mantar here during an RJD-led protest, in which leaders of a number of opposition parties joined in to show solidarity with the victim girls.

The alleged sexual exploitation of girls at a shelter-home in Muzaffarpur had come to light in a social audit conducted by Mumbai-based Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS).

An FIR was lodged by the state social welfare department in June, which led to the arrest of 10 people.

Medical reports have confirmed sexual abuse of more than 30 girls formerly lodged at the shelter home, which has since been sealed. The case was handed over to the CBI last week.

Kumar had yesterday expressed remorse over the sexual abuse of girls at the state-funded shelter-home and asserted that he would ensure the rule of law prevailed in the state.

""It is good that 'Chachaji' (Nitish Kumar) broke his silence on the issue yesterday... But, has his conscience been pricked? Earlier his conscience would be pricked on the smallest of issues. We did the cycle rally from Gaya and today, we have gathered here to demand justice for those girls,"" Tejashwi said.

Even after being alerted, the action was taken months later, he said, alleging, ""Is this an attempt to destroy the evidence as in the Srijan case.""

""Today, as a Bihari, I hang my head in shame. What has happened in this case, shows that it is not 'jungle raj' (misrule) but 'rakshas raj' (devil's rule) in the state,"" he said.

He invoked the characters of Duryodhan from Mahabharta and Ravana from Ramayana to target the chief minister.

""There are 'Duryodhans' robbing the honour of women and 'Ravanas' abducting them in the state,"" he alleged.

""Nitishji talks about girls education and protection but such heinous crimes happen right under the nose of the government. One can see difference in words and deeds.

AAP rejects Punjab unit leaders' resignations, tries to keep flock together","CHANDIGARH: As the crisis-ridden AAP's Punjab unit tries to keep its flock together, a party meeting on Saturday rejected the resignations which the state president and a co-president had submitted in March.


The state unit also announced two events in the coming days, which may help it counter a recent show of strength by the rebel faction led by Sukhbir Singh Cheema.

Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann and Sunam MLA Aman Arora had resigned as the state unit's president and co-president, respectively, to protest against party chief Arvind Kejriwal's decision to apologise to an Akali leader.

State unit co-president Balbir Singh told reporters here that the office bearers have now requested Mann and Arora to continue to lead the AAP in Punjab.

""Bhagwant Mann was the state president of the party and he will remain so. We have sent our recommendations to the national leadership and we are sure that they will agree with what we have decided today,"" he said.

The two leaders had submitted their resignations from the posts after Kejriwal apologised to SAD leader Bikram Majithia for alleging that he was involved in the drug trade.

Senior Aam Aadmi Party leader Manish Sisodia, who is the party's state affairs in-charge, will address an event in Jalandhar on August 13.

On August 15, another party conference will be held at Issru, in which MP Bhagwant Mann and party MLAs will take part.

The current crisis in the Punjab unit erupted after the national leadership replaced Bolath MLA Sukhbir Khaira as Leader of Opposition in the state assembly, naming Harpal Singh Cheema in his place.

Seven other MLAs, out of the 20 the party has in Punjab, then openly come out in Khaira's support, holding a convention in Bathinda on Thursday.

After today's meeting, Cheema dismissed the ""ultimatum"" served by rebel group MLAs who have asked the party to review its decision to replace Khaira.

But he said the party was in touch with Khaira and trying to persuade him to fall in line.

""We are persuading the MLAs to desist from indulging in anti-party activity,"" he said.

When asked if such ""anti-party activity"" will weaken the AAP, Cheema replied, ""After this crisis, the party will emerge stronger, you will see"".

""The party is united,"" he told reporters.

He said the recent developments had not shaken the faith of people in AAP's Punjab unit.

The AAP's state leadership has also decided to invite Arvind Kejriwal to hold a rally in Punjab in October, Balbir Singh said.

At that rally, Kejriwal, Sisodia and Mann will announce the AAP's plans for the 2019 general election, he said.

Meanwhile, the state's unit women's wing demanded that Khaira should apologise for the manner in which two women MLAs, Rupinder Kaur Ruby and Sarabjit Kaur Manuke, were ""targeted"" by his supporters on social media.

Women wing's leader Baljinder Kaur alleged that MLAs were abused for not attending the rebels' Bathinda convention.

40,Unarmed intruder shot dead by CRPF men at Farooq’s house,"JAMMU: An unarmed intruder who barged into former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah’s house after smashing its gate with his SUV was shot dead by CRPF jawans here on Saturday. Farooq, a Lok Sabha MP, was in New Delhi for the Parliament session when the attack took place.


Sources said the 26-year-old intruder, identified as Murad Hussain Shah from Mendhar in Poonch district, entered Farooq’s house in the Bhatindi area after breaching the security barricade. He got into a scuffle with security guards in the garden, injuring one of them, and then rushed inside the house. Murad got into the house from the rear gate, which is used by Farooq and his family members, sources said.

“Murad Hussain Shah rammed his black SUV against the main gate around 10.30am. He then entered the house, ransacking everything that came his way. He was shot dead near the stairs that led to the bedrooms of the house. No weapon was recovered from the vehicle or from the deceased,” police sources said.

Police are not clear about the motive behind the intrusion. “We are investigating the matter,” SSP Jammu Vivek Gupta said, adding that initial reports suggested that Murad was able to gain entry through the front door.

The district collector has ordered a magisterial probe into the incident and an FIR has been filed against Murad under various sections of the IPC, including section 307 (attempt to murder).

Murad’s father Imzad Hussain Shah, who runs a gun factory at Ban-Talab area here, questioned why his son was shot and not arrested at the gate instead. “I want to know why he was killed. Where were the security guards when he breached the gate? Why didn't they arrest him?"" he said.

Locals also suggested that the killing was “mysterious”, saying the youth was often seen entering Farooq’s house before. “He belonged to a well-to-do family with great political connections,” said a neighbour requesting anonymity.

However, a CRPF officer said that Murad was shot only after he ignored several warnings and went on to vandalise Farooq’s house.

Soon after the attack, Farooq’s son and National Conference leader Omar Abdullah tweeted: “I am aware of the incident that took place at the residence my father & I share in Bhatindi, Jammu. Details are sketchy at the moment. Initial reports suggest an intruder was able to gain entry through the front door & into the upper lobby of the house.”

District development commissioner (Jammu) Ramesh Kumar ordered the probe following massive protests by relatives of the slain man, Syeed Murfad Shah, who would have turned 26 next month.

""Sub-divisional magistrate, Jammu North, will conduct the probe and submit his report within four weeks,"" Kumar told PTI.

Meanwhile, the National Conference (NC) sought a high level probe into the incident by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).

NC provincial spokesperson Madan Mantoo issued a statement here, saying, ""As Abdullah is a central government categorised protectee, the government of India should carry out its independent and impartial inquiry by a team deputed by the Ministry of Home Affairs.""

Expressing grave concern over the incident, the spokesperson said the probe must cover all aspects, including how a car was able to gain entry into the supposedly highly secured residence with minimum cosmetic damage, considering the strength of the main gate.

""The security lapse is needed to be probed expeditiously so that the truth comes to the fore,"" the he added.

Following noisy protests by the relatives of the deceased, the Jammu and Kashmir unit of BJP also demanded that an impartial and prompt investigation be conducted into the incident and CCTV footage released.

""BJP demands an impartial and prompt enquiry into the matter of fake encounter. To set at rest the apprehensions of the members of the family of deceased, the CCTV footage should be released to the media by police immediately,"" BJP state spokesperson Anil Gupta said in a statement here.

He said the ""cold-blooded"" murder in a VIP residence raises many questions.

""The family of the deceased is calling the incident a fake encounter and insists that their son was called by somebody to the residence of the former chief minister,"" he said.

Gupta said, quoting friends of the deceased, that the youth was not a drug addict, as was being alleged by some.

In a major security breach this morning, the man rammed his car into the front gate of the residence of Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah here, and vandalised the house before being shot dead by the CRPF personnel guarding the premises, police said.

Both Farooq and Omar Abdullah are Z-plus protectees.

He said that Singh assumed his political role as the finance minister at a time when the country had lost its international credibility in money and finance. ""But Dr Singh through his skill and deftness"" steered the country's economy to a growth trajectory.

Singh, a former Reserve Bank governor, was appointed as the country's finance minister in 1991 by the then Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao when the country's economy was passing through a crisis.

Mukherjee listed a host of legislation including the landmark Right to Information Act and the Food Security Act which were enacted during Singh's tenure as prime minister.

He said Singh displayed ""skill and deftness"" in handling the country's economy and decisively managed the coalition government, ending a period of political instability in the country.

""We will remain grateful to you for providing political stability in the most uncertain time,"" he said.

The former president was speaking at an award function here where Singh was given the lifetime achievement award.

He recalled how the then US President George W Bush had called upon Singh to show light out of the tunnel and restore the world economy when it was passing through a recessionary phase.

He said there was widespread fear during those days that the world economy would slide the way as it happened during the 1930s.

Indian economic credential was also at stake and the country had to pledge 25 tons of gold to the Bank of England just to borrow a few hundred million dollars when nobody was prepared to give loan to India.

But on assuming the role as the finance minister, Singh ""staked his own personal prestige...the skill and deftness with which doctor saheb led the economy in that turbulent period is simply marvellous,"" Mukherjee said.

The V C Padmanabhan Memorial Lifetime Achievement Award, given to Singh, has been instituted by Manappuram Finance Ltd.

45,Mehul Choksi got 'clear report' as no criminal antecedents were found in 2017: Mumbai Police,"MUMBAI: The Mumbai Police on Saturday said they gave a ""clear report"" to jeweller Mehul Choksi last year as no criminal antecedents were found against him.


Police also said they have ordered an inquiry ""into the matter of issuance of police verification report (PVR)"" to Choksi when he obtained the passport here in 2015.

Choksi, now a prime accused in the alleged Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud case, obtained passport under the 'Tatkal' category after the Regional Passport Office (RPO) here granted him ""No Police Verification Required"" status in 2015, a Mumbai Police release said.



Mehul Choksi got citizenship last year, India made no objection: AntiguaIn a statement issued on Thursday night, Antigua’s citizenship by investment unit (CIU) said when Choksi applied for citizenship in May 2017, he provided a “police clearance certificate as required by Section 5(2)(b) of Antigua and Barbuda Citizenship by Investment Act 2013”.


Because of this status, no PVR was generated from the Mumbai Police, it said, adding that an inquiry into the matter has now been ordered.

Choksi is one of the alleged masterminds of the $2 billion scam in state-run Punjab National Bank and is the uncle of fugitive diamantaire Nirav Modi.

Giving a clarification about the issuance of police clearance last year, the release said Choksi had applied for a police clearance certificate (PCC) to RPO, Mumbai, on February 23, 2017.



CBI moves for Mehul Choksi's extraditionThe CBI has sent an extradition request for fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi to the government to be forwarded to Antigua where he has taken citizenship in November last year, an agency official said on Friday.



Officials at the Malabar Hill Police Station, under whose limits he lived, submitted ""a clear report"" on March 10, 2017, stating that no criminal antecedents were found. It was forwarded to RPO, Mumbai, according to the release.

The 'Clear Report' was given after checking the online Criminal Antecedents and Information System (CAIS), it said.

If a person has been arrested in the past, it is reflected in the CAIS, the release said.

Choksi left the country on January 1 this year, and an offence was registered against him by the CBI on January 31 (in the PNB scam), it noted.

Now, the city police are also examining their ""internal processes involved in the criminal antecedents verification process to improve the existing system"", the release added.

A newspaper report from Antigua has said that Indian authorities did not give any adverse report to stall Choksi's citizenship application in that country last year.

Choksi's application for citizenship in Antigua in May 2017 was accompanied with clearance from the local police as required by norms, Antiguan newspaper the Daily Observer reported.

As the news report created a furore, a spokesperson of the ministry of external affairs had said yesterday that PCC was issued by the passport office of Mumbai for Antigua and Barbuda on the basis of a clear PVR available on his passport.

""As the PVR of Mehul Choksi was clear in the system at the time of issuance of PCC, the process followed by Passport Office, Mumbai, was as per extant instructions,"" he had said.

46,CWC is 'corruption wali committee': BJP,"NEW DELHI: The BJP on Saturday described the Congress Working Committee (CWC) as ""corruption wali committee"" (committee of corruption) hours after it resolved to take on the government on the issue of graft.


BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said every act of corruption in India is linked to the party and it was peddling lies and misleading people against the government.

""The Congress has hard connection with corruption. Wherever corruption happens in India, it goes to 10 Janpath. 10 Janpath is the permanent address of corruption in India and every act of corruption leads to the Gandhi family,"" he said.

10 Janpath is the official residence of UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi.

The ruling party also dismissed allegation of irregularities committed by the Modi government in fixing prices of the Rafale fighter jets, saying the Congress is spreading lies on the issue as it is ""frustrated"" over the absence of any middlemen in the purchase deal.

""He (Rahul Gandhi) told Parliament that French president said something in his ears. Within hours the French government issued a statement exposing his lies. Can there be anything more humiliating than this. He was criticised the world over and it happened for the first time that another country had to intervene...and issue a letter. But Rahul is carrying on with his lies,"" Patra said.

He said the government took a decision on Rafale jets at a time when the squadron strength was vastly depleted and the Congress did nothing between 2002 and 2012 to address this issue.

Patra also accused the Congress of playing vote bank politics on the controversy surrounding Assam's National Register of Citizens (NRC) and said that the party was only interested in having a ""national register of illegal immigrants"".

Seeking to expose the party's hypocrisy on the issue, he said that while the party did not allow BJP president and Rajya Sabha MP Amit Shah from speaking on the issue in the Upper House of Parliament, its leaders were deliberating upon it in the CWC meeting.

""Is CWC more important than Parliament,"" he wondered.

Taking a dig at the CWC members over allegations of corruption they face, he said it is ""corruption wali committee"".

Countering the Congress claim of the Modi government's complicity and connivance in allowing bank scan accused Mehul Choksi to flee from the country and getting him citizenship of Antigua, Patra pointed to an interview given by Mehul Choksi's Antiguan lawyer David Dorsett where he had reportedly said that Choksi was being targeted as he had a ""loose"" connection with the Congress.

He said that the interview has established the fact that the Congress has ""hard connection with corruption and wherever corruption happens in India, it leads to 10 Janpath"".

He also took potshots at the party, alleging that it extended loans to friends and near and dear ones without collateral security.

""Congress party acted as loan-giving agent and BJP is acting as recovery agent,"" he said.

He said that the Opposition's seriousness and concern about the plight of farmers was exposed in the ongoing session of Parliament when none of its leaders were present when a discussion was taken up about issues concerning them.

Asked about Congress allegation about growing unemployment in the country, Patra said they are spreading lies on the issue as ""Rahul and company have themselves become politically unemployed"".

""The BJP has been doing politics while keeping temples in the centre. The party has always worked to force its divisive thought and misled people in the name of religion,"" Rajasthan Congress president Sachin Pilot said here.

He alleged that the BJP has emotionally exploited people. ""More than 300 temples were demolished in the state capital in the name of construction for the metro corridor,"" Pilot said.

Reacting to the Congress leader's remarks, BJP national vice president Avinash Rai Khanna said the party has always begun its yatra after seeking blessings at local temples.

""Like the Congress, we do not do the politics of showing off. (Congress president) Rahul Gandhi had gone to temples in Gujarat and Karnataka during assembly elections and pretended to worship. The BJP does not believe in such kind of politics,"" he said.

Pilot also condemned BJP president Amit Shah's comment on Gandhi.

In his address at the launch of the yatra, Shah said the public wants to know from ""Rahul Baba"" the account of works done by ""four generations"" during Congress rule in the country.

Jaipur district Congress president Pratap Singh Khachariya and other leaders and workers burnt an effigy of the BJP government at the Collectorate circle.

He said that the government is funding the political yatra, which is misuse of the taxpayer's money.

""The BJP government is misusing taxpayers' money which is a betrayal,"" Khachariya said.

Of the total 58 days of schedule, 40 days will be of yatra and 18 days will be off.

Raje will cover 165 out of total 200 assembly constituencies during the yatra which will culminate in Ajmer's Pushkar town on September 30.

Flaunting his Aadhaar card Prasad said, “I want to dispense some myths around Aadhaar. What does it contain? It contains my photograph and my permanent Patna address. It does not contain my caste, my religion, medical record, income records and matrimonial record, nothing. There is nothing in this card for which I can be trolled.” He was addressing a gathering on the occasion of inauguration of Software Technology Park of India’s new facility STPI ELITE here on Saturday. 

Clarifying about the concerns over data theft from Aadhaar, Prasad said, “The system contains my core bio metrics – my ten finger prints and my iris, which is kept in safe condition, secured and encrypted form. It cannot be broken by the billionth of effort. It is all home grown technology”, he said.

He further said, as many as 3.5 crore authentication are done every day and 95 crore bank accounts are linked with Aadhaar, which is a digital identity to supplement physical identity. “You can change your name but you can’t change your biometrics and iris. That’s a clear Indian innovation, backed by a parliamentary law with due regards to privacy, safety and security of each and every citizen,” he added.

Prasad along with Union oil and petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan inaugurated the second data centre for National Data Depository that stores country's sedimentary data for future use in oil and gas exploration and production located in the premises of STPI ELITE.

The state-of-the-art facility housed STPI’s Next Generation incubation facility, fabrication lab and data centre to cater the need of the IT/ITES/ESDM industries of the state.

“STPI’s innovative incubation model will spearhead the creation of employment, business growth and entrepreneurship in Odisha. The integrated facilities will work as an innovation hub which would encourage innovation, IPR creation, product development and offer a vibrant ecosystem for building a maker culture among the young techno-entrepreneurs, start-ups and boost the IT exports from the region,” said Prasad after inaugurating the facility.

The STPI ELITE has also been included in the Rental Subsidy Scheme of Odisha government under which the incubatees can avail the facility at an affordable cost and ensure a sustainable growth, official sources said.

On the occasion Union oil and petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan had an interactive session with geologists from across the state. “The data centre which is the second largest after the one in Noida, will strengthen the economic ecosystem of Odisha. The centre will also help in attracting private investment in oil and natural gas sector,” Pradhan said.

“Of the total assistance, Rs 5 lakh will be provided as subsidy, while the rest Rs 5 lakh as interest-free loan, to be returned in 84 instalments. Moreover, the repayment instalment would begin only after the proposed industry or trade will start its operation.

Banks used to reject their applications on one or the other pretext or lack of required documents. “Under this state government’s scheme, the loan is being granted on self-declaration of the beneficiary,” he said.

In his address, Nitish recounted how his government had been actively working for development of all sections of the society. “We are doing works for all sections of the society, but giving special attention for progress of the weaker section. we have taken several steps to bring the members of the SC/ ST communities in the mainstream of the society,” he said.

A total of five FIRs have been registered against Banerjee in Assam since the publication of the NRC final draft on July 30.

Two police complaints were also filed against Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal in West Bengal yesterday.

Police said effigies of Banerjee, who is opposing the NRC in Assam, were burnt and protests held against her across Assam during the day.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central) Ranjan Bhuyan said the two FIRs were registered at Guwahati and Silchar for allegedly creating disturbances on the basis of religion.

One FIR was registered at the Geetanagar police station here on the basis of a complaint by the Assam Public Works' Dhrubajyoti Talukdar last night and the other at the Udharband police station at Cachar today by a policewoman, who was injured during an alleged scuffle with the visiting TMC members at the Silchar airport, he said.

A police officer said the first FIR has been registered against Banerjee and the eight-member TMC team under the Indian Penal Code sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language) and 298 (uttering words with deliberate intent to wound the religious feelings of any person).

The FIR at Cachar was registered for violating Section 144, which was in place then and attacking a public servant on duty, he said.

On August 2, one FIR each was registered against Banerjee at Panbazar and Basistha here and at North Lakhimpur police station for her alleged ""instigating remarks"" that threatened the unity of the country and her ""attempt to create unrest"" in Assam.

Following it, Banerjee had said in Kolkata, ""We know we are living in a super emergency. There is no democracy in the country. I am not scared. I speak for the people. They (BJP) can lodge millions of FIRs against me, I do not care.""

The two complaints against Sonowal were filed by TMC MLA Mohua Moitra and MP Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar, both members of the TMC team, for alleged manhandling and illegal detention at the airport after their return from Silchar.

The TMC team, comprising six MPs, one MLA and a West Bengal minister was kept under preventive detention by the Assam Police at the Silchar airport after they reached there on August 2 to take stock of the situation following the publication of the NRC final draft and were sent back on August 3.
